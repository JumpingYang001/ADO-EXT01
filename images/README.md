# Logo Placeholder

This directory should contain the extension logo (logo.png).
For now, create a simple 128x128 pixel PNG image for the extension icon.

The logo should represent the cascading/hierarchical nature of the control.
Consider using:
- Tree-like icons
- Nested boxes
- Hierarchical list representations
- Multi-select checkboxes arranged in a tree structure
